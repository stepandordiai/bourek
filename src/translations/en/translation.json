    "cellulite": {
        "chapters": "Chapters",
        "chapter_1": "Cellulite – how to treat it?",
        "chapter_1_info_1": "Cellulite causes the skin to have an uneven, dimpled surface, resembling the peel of an orange. Cellulite affects more than 90% of women. The risk is increased during pregnancy, but it also affects women in menopause and girls during puberty.",
        "chapter_1_info_2": "It is related to the action of the female hormone estrogen, which is why it is more common in women using contraceptives that contain these hormones. Cellulite is not related to being overweight, as even slim women suffer from it. The bumps on the skin are not formed by unnecessary fat deposits, but are the result of changes in the subcutaneous fatty tissue, in which water is retained. The skin structure disorder mainly affects the hips, thighs, and buttocks.",
        "chapter_1_info_3": "In younger women, the changes in the skin are not very noticeable because their tissues are still elastic. As they age, they become more obvious, as fat deposits in the subcutaneous tissue increase and bumps and dimples appear on the surface of the skin.",
        "chapter_1_info_4": "In more severe cases of cellulite, there is extensive swelling all over the body, which can be reduced by massage, which removes excess fluid from the affected areas. Cellulite can be hereditary. However, as with most diseases, heredity may not manifest itself unless other triggering factors are added.",
        "chapter_1_info_5": "The cause of cellulite is also an incorrect lifestyle, when the body becomes clogged with toxins, undigested metabolites and suffers from a lack of minerals and vitamins. Lack of exercise, sedentary work, stress, smoking and a diet rich in animal proteins, fats and sugars also contribute to its development. Liver failure can also be the cause.",
        "chapter_1_info_6": "Special massages, for example with our STARVAC SP2 device, can be supplemented in the treatment of cellulite by using preparations containing ginkgo biloba, clover, grape seeds and bladderwrack. These preparations will improve the internal nutrition of tissues, increase the breakdown of fats in cells and protect against changes in connective tissue. Hormonal disorders are therefore one of the causes of cellulite.",
        "chapter_1_info_7": "According to some authors, birth control pills or other types of endocrine treatment may contribute to the development of cellulite. Estrogens block the action of vitamin E, which promotes blood circulation, and vitamin B6, which has a diuretic effect and removes retained fluid from the tissues. Disruption of the function of these two vitamins is enough to cause a deviation in fluid exchange - the formation of fat, which is a prerequisite for the development of cellulite.",
        "chapter_1_info_8": "Estrogens burn folic acid, a very valuable element from the B vitamin group. They also block the function of vitamin C, which has an anti-aging effect, and vitamin B 12 (important for skin physiology). A common cause of cellulite is poor blood and lymphatic circulation, which is caused by lack of exercise. Lymph must flow in the body and remove toxic substances from it. However, it does not have its own pump like the blood circulation of the heart, so we must get it moving in the body, preferably twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, with half an hour of exercise. Also, brisk walking, swimming, and dancing are ideal movements.",
        "chapter_1_info_9": "It is advisable to massage your entire body every morning and evening with a brush or a special glove. Start by stroking from the feet to the knees, then continue from the knees to the hips. Then a few circles on the stomach and chest. Then along the arms from the wrists to the shoulders, down the back as far as it will go and up the buttocks. Do this for as long as you feel comfortable. It is good to do the massage before bathing. Never massage varicose veins!!!!! You can also alternate hot and cold showers. You can also stimulate lymphatic circulation with essential oils (juniper, grapefruit, rosemary). Twice a week, a professional manual lymphatic massage or a massage with a device such as STARVAC SP2 should be performed at our physiotherapy workplace RELAX CENTRUM.",
        "chapter_1_info_10": "It is important to release waste products and toxins from the tissues and also to try to keep harmful substances in our body as low as possible. When cleansing the body, you must try to eliminate all harmful substances from your diet - sugar, sweets, sausages, chips, instant products, white bread, ketchup, mayonnaise, etc. In the morning, you can eat only fruit in warm weather, and during the day, whole grain bread, poultry, fish, cereals, white yogurt, legumes, fresh vegetables. You can hold a fruit or vegetable fast one day a week. However, do not mix fruit and vegetables together!!!!!. It is important to drink enough, at least 2.5 - 3 liters a day, preferably pure water or pressed fruit or vegetable juices, teas with a detoxifying effect on liver function.",
        "chapter_2": "Orange peel skin – a punishment for comfort",
        "chapter_2_info_1": "It's called cellulite, but doctors prefer to use the technical term dermopañiculosis. The term orange peel is more poetic, but it's always the same thing - fat that accumulates under the skin like curdled cottage cheese.",
        "chapter_2_info_2": "The result? Even the best swimsuits cannot cover up the many bumps - especially on the thighs and buttocks, but also on the arms - resembling the peel of a ripe orange. The sight of such skin certainly does not please any woman. Fat cells make their way through the loose tissues, and an uneven bumpy surface of the skin begins to form. And who is to blame for this? Chromosomes can contribute to the development of cellulite - classic heredity, but also so-called habitual heredity, which is the adoption of bad eating habits from the family. Lack of exercise - all this promotes dermopaniculosis. In a way, it is a civilization issue.",
        "chapter_3": "Frequently asked questions and answers",
        "chapter_3_info_1": "Does a daughter whose mother already has cellulite also have to come to terms with cellulite?",
        "chapter_3_secondary_info_1": "It doesn't have to. The distribution of subcutaneous tissue and therefore the type of body are already given at birth, but the thickness of subcutaneous fat can be influenced. Through exercise, a suitable diet, massages - manual or machine - the STARVAC SP2 device.",
        "chapter_3_info_2": "There is talk about the negative effects of bubble waters, do they promote the formation of cellulite?",
        "chapter_3_secondary_info_2": "Everything that overacidifies the body (including coffee) increases cellulite, that's true. But carbonated water alone won't get rid of cellulite. What's more important is your drinking regimen. We should drink around 3 liters of fluid daily.",
        "chapter_3_info_3": "Can liposuction be used to radically remove cellulite?",
        "chapter_3_secondary_info_3": "Absolutely not. Liposuction will get rid of, for example, unpleasant lumps on your sides, but it is definitely not recommended as a solution to cellulite. Creams and definitely massages can improve the condition. These should follow every bath, even just as a prevention. After a massage, the skin will be well supplied with blood. If you drink enough fluids and do massages, the fat will also leave the body with the fluids, because it is soaked with water. In addition, a proper diet, enough exercise and the condition of the skin will improve.",
        "chapter_3_info_4": "How to proceed with a massage?",
        "chapter_3_secondary_info_4": "The massage starts from the feet up to the knees, then continues from the knees to the hips. The breasts and abdomen are massaged in gentle circular motions. The same goes for the hands, from the wrists to the elbows and then to the shoulders. How to proceed with the massage? How to proceed with the massage? And one final note for ladies! Do not wear short skirts in winter. When your legs freeze, the body protects itself by moving fat to the thighs and buttocks.",
        "chapter_4": "Cellulite – a short summary at the end",
        "chapter_4_info_1": "Cellulite - orange peel skin is considered primarily a cosmetic problem that affects more or less 90% of women. However, cellulite is related to insufficient activity of the lymphatic system and blood circulation. Due to an improper diet, the body is clogged with toxins and undigested metabolites that the lymphatic system is unable to eliminate. In such a situation, tissues suffer from insufficient nutrition, especially minerals and vitamins. The result is changes in the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Another factor in the development of cellulite is impaired fat metabolism, which may be related to impaired liver function.",
        "chapter_4_info_2": "Cellulite mainly affects the hips, thighs, buttocks. Mild cellulite is only visible when we press the skin between our fingers. In stage 2, you can already see the orange peel when you stand, but it disappears as soon as you lie down. This means that in mild cellulite there is no inflammation yet. Stage 3, which is moderate cellulite, the orange peel is visible even when you lie down. A large amount of fluid has accumulated in the cellulite focus, sometimes there are also weakened blood capillaries and cooler skin.",
        "chapter_5": "What promotes cellulite?",
        "chapter_5_info_1": "Bad eating habits (sugar, cakes, chocolate, sausages, chips, instant and canned foods, white bread, mayonnaise, fatty meats and sauces, excessive salting), insufficient fluid intake.",

        "chapter_6_info_1": "A healthy diet with a preference for fruits and vegetables, whole grains and breads, legumes, low-fat meats and dairy products.",
        "chapter_6_info_2": "maintaining an optimal drinking regimen, which means drinking 2-3 liters of clean water, preferably without bubbles, herbal unsweetened tea, fruit and vegetable juices.",
        "chapter_6_info_3": "movement in any form. Lymph must flow in the body and remove toxins from the body. However, it does not have its own pump like the blood circulation (heart), so we must get the lymph moving in the body.",
        "chapter_6_info_4": "We can stimulate lymph flow with massages – for example, massaging the entire body with a clothes brush or a special sisal glove in the morning and evening.",
        "chapter_6_info_5": "alternating hot and cold showers (shower for 60-80 seconds with hot water and 20 seconds with cold water)",

        "info_4": "Lymphatic drainage affects the lymphatic system, which is a system of nodes connected by lymphatic vessels, in which lymph circulates. The transport of lymph is ensured passively by a muscle pump and by the movement of the diaphragm during breathing. Due to prolonged standing or sitting, lack of movement, after injuries or due to infection, the function of the entire system deteriorates, pain and swelling of the limbs occur. Our lymphatic drainage relaxes the lymphatic vessels and nodes, improves the flow of lymph in the vessels, and improves blood circulation.",
